# Explain growth mindset

I believe the best way to explain growth mindset is by looking at it as positive reinforcement with each situtation faced. Instead of immediately putting yourself down and overwhelming yourself with the task at hand, you build yourself brick-by-brick to reinforce your thought processes. 

# 3 reminders

1. Go into every new situation with a clear mind and ready to absorb any and all information
2. I always tell myself "I ***can***, I ***will***, I ***must***!"
3. If I ever feel to stressed in a situation walk away and do something else for a little while
