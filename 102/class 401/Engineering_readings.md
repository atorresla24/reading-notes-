# Engineering readings

1. The one thing I can bring to this career is reliability. If a task is requested from me know that it is getting done as efficiently as possible. If I am needed to step up to lead or to take responsibility I can uphold that position. I can make the hard decisions and move forward even if I am the only one that sees the value in the decision. 
2. Three things I'll start doing to "un-stuck" myself whenever I get stuck on tough pieces of code, logic or features are knowing when to take a break, knowing how/when to ask for help, and continue to grind but keep myself healthy mentally/physically. 

## Things I want to know more about

- I want to know more on how I can better absorb the information I am learning
- I want to be able to shorten the time frame it takes for me to read and understand something
- I want to know how I can continue to challenge myself even after the courses are over
