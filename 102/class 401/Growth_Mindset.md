# Upgrade your technical skills with deliberate practice

- By building software everyday doesn't mean you're getting better at it, improving your hard technical skills makes the software you build better
- Deliberate practice is needed to build hard technical skill
- There is a difference between writing code and the way you write the code
- Key ideas behind deliberate practice:
  - Pushes you just outside your comfort zone
  - Repeated often
  - Feedback on results in continuously available
  - It's highly demanding mentally
  - It's difficult
  - It requires good goals
- To increase your own skill you need to try and continuously challenge yourself, see different perspectives and different solutions

# Carol Dweck on the Growth Mindset

## The power of yet

- It allows the understanding of a learning curve

## The tyranny of now

- Cheat vs Study
- Look for someone who did worse than them
- Run from difficulty

## How to build the bridge to yet

- Praise the process of trying
- Rewarding yet, by use of effort
- Students who aren't taught a growth mindset showed a coninuation into a downward spiral of grades while the opposite happens with the latter

# Angela Lee Duckworth on Grit

- In education we need a deeper understanding of the relationship between students and motivation
- Grit is passion and perseverance for long term goals
- Grit matters everywhere you can learn anything 
- Grit is not proportional to talent
- Ability to learn is related to effort (not fixed it is mutable)
- Failure is considered not a permanent condition

# Alain de Botton on Redefining Success

- A way to look at materialism is not people wanting materials but rather them looking for a reward
- Envy linked to spirit of quality
- Envy is linked to relatability
- Meritocrisy means that someone is somewhere in life because they put themselves there
- Fear of failure stems from judgement from others
- It is not possible on succeeding in everything
- There is relative balance but no such thing as ideal balance
- Be the author of your own ambition

# Measuring Emotional Intelligence

I scored above an 18 on all aspects except self-management. I can be very observant and understanding of others' situations and actions and know how to appropriately act in response. However, while I can be observant of my own situations and actions I find it difficult to uphold myself to the same response I hold others up to. I will always be harder on myself to be better and configure myself in any way to be better but will never recommend to another person what I would do. I have definitely grown in this aspect but it is still more or less similar to how I have always been.

# Bias Self-Assessment

I have high self awareness, curiosity and courage as stated by the results of my assessment. I tend to understand others and the events that go on around me. While many situations have not happened to me, I am able to see different perspectives and put myself in others situations. I am able to consciously create a simulation that allows me to try and understand a similar scenario and come up with the best routes to take.
