## API Design Best Practices

1. REST stands for Representational State Transfer.
2. REST APIs are designed around resources
3. An example of an identifier of a resource is a specific URI for a particular customer order.
4. The most common HTTP verbs are GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE
5. URIs should be based on URLs
6. An example of a URI is a collection of orders
7. By having a 'chatty' web API is a bad thing because it means that it exposes a large number of small which may require a client application ti send multiple requests to find all data.
8. The status code a successful GET request returns is 200
9. The status code an unsuccessful GET request returns is 204
10. The status code a successful POST request returns is 201
11. The status code an unsuccessful POST request returns is 400
