## How I explained REST to my brother

1. Roy Felding is someone who helped write the first web servers 
2. The techniques that we use today don't work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world because because they weren't designed to do that.
3. The HTTP protocol that Felding and his friends created is allabout applying verbs to nouns. 
4. A 'get' allows systems to get information fron each other
5. A 'post' allows one system to add something to another system
6. A 'put' allows one system to replace something in another system.
7. A 'patch' will do a partial update
