## React Docs = Forms

1. A controlled component is an input form element that renders a form and also controls what happens in that form
2. The state should be updated as soon as the user inputs them because then the value can be passed to other UI elements or it can be reset from other event handlers.
3. We target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field by adding an input type. 

## The conditional (ternary) operator explained

1. We use ternary operators because it allows us to run a certain block of code if a certain condition is met
2. ?(
  x === y, 
  console.log(true)
) : (
  console.log(false)
);
