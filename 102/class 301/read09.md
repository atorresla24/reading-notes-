## Functional Programming Concepts

1. Functional programming is a programming paradigm - a style of building the structure and elements of a computer programs - that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data
2. We know if a function is a pure function if it returns the same result if given the same arguments and if it does not cause any observable side effects
3. The benefits of a pure function are they are easier to test and immutable.

5. Referential transparency is when a function yields the same result for the same input consistently.
