# Reading 02

## React lifecycle 

1. Based on the diagram the 'render' came before the 'componentDidMount'
2. The first thing to happen in the lifecycle of react is the mounting of the constructor
3. constructor, render, react updates, componentDidMount, componentWillUnmount
4. componentDidMount is a method that is invoked immediately after a component is mounted; setState() can be called here 

## React State Vs Props

1. You can pass arguments to a function in props
2. Props are passed into a compoenent (outside a component) while states are handled inside of components 
3. We rerender our application when the state is changed
4. Examples of things that can be stored inside of state are input element, checkbox, selector box
