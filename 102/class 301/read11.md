## NoSQL vs SQL (Reading)

Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

SQL	                     
1. SQL databases are primarily called Relational Databases(RDBMS).
2. SQL databases are table based and represent data in forms of tables which consists of n number of rows.
3. SQL databases have predefined schema 
NoSQL.
4. Vertically scalable and scaled by increasing the horse-power of the hardware.
1. NoSQL databases are primarily called non-relational or distributed database.
5. SQL is used for defining and manipulating data
2. NoSQL databases are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases, or wide-column stores which do not have standard schema definitions.
3. NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data.
4. Horizontally scalable and scaled by increasing the databases servers in the pool of resources.
5. NoSQL queries are focused on colllection of documents

1. SQL databases are a good fit for complex query intensive environment
2. An example is a high transactional based application and SQL are a best fit for these types of applications because they are more stable and promises the atomicity as well as integrity of the data. 
3. NoSQL databases best fit hierarchical data storage because it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data.
4. An example of this is Hbase because NoSQL is meant to handle large data sets
5. NoSQL are the best for hierarchical data
6. SQL databases are probably better for scalability because they can manage increasing load by increasing the CPU, RAM, SSD, etc. on a single server.

## SQL vs NoSQL (Video)

1. SQL stands for structured query language
2. A relational database means it works with certain assumptions or in a certain way and it works with SQL.
3. SQL works with a products-table structure
4. A schema is defined by fields and defines which data can go into a table
5. A NoSQL database is the shop databse
6. It works by having your shop database which is then broken down into collections, the user and the orders, and then into documents. 
7. A Mongo database consists of collections which consists of documents.
8. A MongoDB is more flexible since it doesn't use schemas and so its data is organized in a less strict and predictable manner.  
9. The disadvantage of a NoSQL database is less predictable, and there is a limit to how much data can be stored by vertical scaling. 

## Things I want to know more about

I want to know more about how to make the decision between which database to use. Which database works better for what types of applications?

Are some of the trade offs better than others?

Which database would it be harder to increase the data storage on?
