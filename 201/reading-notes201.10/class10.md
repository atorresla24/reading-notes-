## Chapter 10: Error Handling and Debugging

* If you understand execution contexts (which have two stages) and stacks, you are more likely to find the error in your code
* Debugging is the process of finding errors. It involves a process of deduction
* The console helps narrow down the area in which the error is located, so you can try to find the exact error
* JavaScript has 7 different types of errors. Each creates its own error object, which can tell you its line number and gives a description of the error
* If you know that you may get an error, you can handle it gracefully using the try, catch, finally statements. Use them to give your users helpful feedback

## Things I want to know more about

* I want to be able to get better at debugging by being able to recognize anomalies in a code
* I want to be able to know how to fix an anomaly in my code once it is found
