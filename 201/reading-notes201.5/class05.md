# Class 05 reading notes:

## Chapter 5: Images

* <img> is used to add images
* Must always specify a src attribute to indicate source of image and alt attribute to describe the content
* Should save images at the size that will be used and appropriately fit page format
* Photographs are best saved as JPEGs

## Chapter 11: Color

* Color brings site to life and also conveys mood and evokes reactions
* Three ways to specify color:
  - RGB values
  - Hex codes
  - Color names
* Color pickers can help find the color you want
* Important to ensure there is enough contrast between text and background color
* CSS3 has opacity indicators known as RGBA and HSLA

## Chapter 12: Text

* There are properties that control font, size, weight, style, and spacing
* Limited choice of fonts
* Several options to use wider range of typefaces but only if you have the proper license
* You can control the space between line of text, individual letters and words and it can be aligned to the left, right, center, or justified and indented
* Psuedo-classes can be used to change style of an element when a user hovers over or clicks on text

## JPEG v PNG v GIF:

* Use JPEG format for images that contain a natural scene or photograph where variation in color and intensity is smooth
* Use PNG format for any image that needs transparency or for images with text and objects with sharp contrast edges
* Use GIF format for images that contain animation
* Two types of compression:
  - **Lossless**- possible to reconstruct original image from compressed image because there is no info lost during compression
  - **Lossy**- data loss is irreversible

* JPEG is lossy
* PNG is lossless
* GIF is lossless

* Transparency indicates something that is completely invisible 
* JPEG doesn't support transparency
* PNG and GIF support transparency

* Significant difference in number of colors that can be supported by the three formats
* JPEG supports around 16 million colors
* PNG images support two modes: PNG8(256 colors) and PNG24(16 million colors)
* GIF images support 256 colors
