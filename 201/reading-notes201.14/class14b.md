# What Google learned from its quest to build the perfect team

Rozovsky's study group was strong as individuals but weak as a group while her case group was still strong individually but even stronger as a group

The world is moving towards group-oriented success rather than individual successes

If a company wants to get the best results it needs its to grow its groups more so than individuals

Google started a project in 2012 called Arisotle which studied individual's traits and tendencies to understand what would create the best group

Google couldn't find any relevant patterns, even some teams that were almost identical in makeup didn't produce the same results

The team of researchers on Porject Aristotle began looking for group norms to possibly see if their was some type of commmon behavior that would lead a team to effectiveness

Collective IQ would increase if there was some type of equality amongst time talking

Also, the high collective IQ teams would possess "high social sensitivity" which means they understood what each other felt and thought without having to converse about it

Psychological saftey was another key factor in team success

Psychological safety and emotional conversation were in a way connected
